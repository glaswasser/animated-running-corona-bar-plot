ANIMATED BARPLOTS
================

This is largely inspired and / or copied from the following two sources:
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53162821/animated-sorted-bar-chart-with-bars-overtaking-each-other>

<https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-create-bar-race-animation-charts-in-r/>

I added as much comments in the code as possible. Have fun recreating /
improving\!

The final result: ![](confirmed_cases.gif)
