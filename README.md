ANIMATED BARPLOTS
================

I really like these animated barplots and was wondering if it’s possible
in R to create such beautiful animations. I dug the web and
stackoverflow and R-bloggers had answers for me. It is indeed possible
to create nice animation movies out of plots in R and save them as GIF
or mp4\!

# Goals:

  - create a bar plot as known from “data is beautiful” (youtube
    <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkWbqlDAyJh2n8DN5X6NZyg>)
  - use n-COVID-19 data to see the top countries animated
  - smoothen it up\!

This is largely inspired and / or copied from the following two
sources:

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53162821/animated-sorted-bar-chart-with-bars-overtaking-each-other>

<https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-create-bar-race-animation-charts-in-r/>

I added as much comments in the code as possible. Have fun recreating /
improving\!
